# Todo-3-Tier-Monolithic-Application-Deployment-on-Azure-Cloud


#### This repository contains a full-stack 3-tier monolithic Todo application built using the following technologies:



🗂️ This project follows a monolithic architecture, meaning all components- 3-Tier Todo Monolithic App using 🌐 React (frontend), 🧠 Python(backend), and 🗄️ Azure SQL (database). 

All layers are integrated in a single deployable unit—ideal for learning, prototyping, or small to mid-size production apps.

#### 🌐 Frontend: React (JavaScript)

#### 🧠 Backend: Python

#### 🗄️ Database: Azure SQL Database


## 🧱 Architecture Overview

        [ React Frontend ] ⇄ [ Python Backend ] ⇄ [ Azure SQL Database ]

The React frontend serves as the presentation layer, allowing users to manage their todo items with a clean and responsive interface.

The Python backend acts as the application layer, containing the business logic and RESTful API endpoints to perform CRUD operations.

The Azure SQL Database stores all todo records, providing persistent and secure storage through SQL queries.

All communication between layers happens internally, and the entire application is packaged to run as a single service.
